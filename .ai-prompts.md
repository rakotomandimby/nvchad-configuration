# Disable tabs

I want to disable tabs when opening multiple files in a single window.

I've set `ui.tabs.enabled` to `false` in my `./lua/chadrc.lua` file, but tabs are still visible:

```lua
M.ui = {
  tabs = {
    enabled = false,
  },
}
```
What am I doing wrong?

It looks like you're on the right track by setting `ui.tabs.enabled = false` in your `chadrc.lua` file. However, the issue might be that the tabline is still being rendered by another part of the configuration or a plugin.

Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and ensure that tabs are disabled:

### 1. **Check if the Tabline is Being Set by a Plugin**
Some plugins or configurations might still be enabling the tabline. You can explicitly disable the tabline in your `options.lua` file by setting the `showtabline` option to `0`:

```lua
-- In lua/options.lua
require "nvchad.options"

-- Disable the tabline
vim.opt.showtabline = 0
```

This will ensure that the tabline is not shown, even if multiple files are opened.

### 2. **Ensure the `chadrc.lua` Configuration is Loaded Properly**
Make sure that your `chadrc.lua` file is being loaded correctly. You can add a simple print statement to verify that the configuration is being applied:

```lua
-- In lua/chadrc.lua
---@type ChadrcConfig
local M = {}

M.base46 = {
  theme = "material-lighter",
}

M.ui = {
  tabs = {
    enabled = false, -- Disable tabs entirely
  },
}

print("chadrc.lua loaded!")  -- Add this line to check if the file is loaded

return M
```

When you start Neovim, check if the message `"chadrc.lua loaded!"` appears. If it doesn't, there might be an issue with how the configuration is being sourced.

### 3. **Check for Conflicting Plugins**
Some plugins, like `bufferline.nvim`, might still be rendering a tabline or bufferline. If you're using such a plugin, you may need to disable it or configure it to not show tabs.

For example, if you're using `bufferline.nvim`, you can disable it by removing or commenting out its configuration in your `plugins/init.lua` file.

### 4. **Reload Neovim**
After making these changes, make sure to restart Neovim or reload the configuration to see if the tabs are disabled.

### Final Configuration Example

Hereâ€™s a summary of the changes you might need to make:

#### `lua/chadrc.lua`
```lua
---@type ChadrcConfig
local M = {}

M.base46 = {
  theme = "material-lighter",
}

M.ui = {
  tabs = {
    enabled = false, -- Disable tabs entirely
  },
}

return M
```

#### `lua/options.lua`
```lua
require "nvchad.options"

-- Disable the tabline
vim.opt.showtabline = 0
```

#### `lua/plugins/init.lua`
If you're using a plugin like `bufferline.nvim`, make sure to disable or remove it from the plugin list.

After making these changes, the tabs should no longer be visible when opening multiple files in a single window. Let me know if this resolves the issue!


# ChadrcConfig

When opening `./lua/chadrc.lua`, I have my LSP telling me about the fact that `ChadrcConfig` is not defined nor is it an alias.

But the worst is the "print" statement that is not working. I don't see the message `"chadrc.lua loaded!"` when I start Neovim.

This means the `chadrc.lua` file is not being loaded.

How do I make sure that my `chadrc.lua` file is loaded correctly?

# Which Key Menu

I want to setup a which-key menu the commands starting with 'AI' that I configured in `./lua/plugins/code-ai.lua`.

Tell me how to do it, knwowing that the which-key plugin has recently updated the way to set up menus.

Answer me with the files names and full file contents that I need to modify or create.
